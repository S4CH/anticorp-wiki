# Anticorpware Wiki

### What the fuck is this?

We run a private Discord/ XMPP/ Matrix server wherein most of our members post #resources related to a lot of cool stuff. That shit was getting out of control, in order to give #resources some structure and for the sake of longevity, it was mutually decided to spin up a Wiki for the same.

### Can I contribute?

No, it's strictly member-only. Please don't bombard us with PRs, doing so will only lead to them being rejected. We hope you understand this Wiki is strictly for book-keeping purposes and is not a community resource.

You're free to use stuff mentioned in our Wiki though :)

### How do I get an invite?

No, you don't.
